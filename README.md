# Blood Customizer
A plugin for Mortal Kombat 1 which allows to change blood color for everyone.

# Installation

**Blood Customizer was only tested with latest Steam version!**

There's 2 versions, standalone and MK1Hook plugin version which allows to use both mods at once.

You can download binary files from [Releases](https://github.com/ermaccer/MK11.BloodCustomizer/releases) page. 

...EHP.zip is a plugin for MK1Hook.

Extract **BloodCustomizer.zip** to MK12\Binaries\Win64 folder of Mortal Kombat 1 (so that **dsound.dll/MK1.BloodCustomizer.ehp** ends up near **SDL2.dll**).

If you are not sure how to find your Mortal Kombat 1 folder, search for it in your Steam library then right click on the entry and select Manage->Browse local files.
